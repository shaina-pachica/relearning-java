Look at the code editor in the file Main.java. 
We have created a Main class with no method except main() and the class constructor.

Run the code and observe the output.

Notice that main() is very lengthy and contains many print statements. The repetitive code can be tedious to write if we need to make more than five deposits.

In this lesson, weâ€™ll learn how to make methods to deposit, withdraw, and check account balance for the SavingsAccount class.

Main.java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SavingsAccount savings = new SavingsAccount(2000);
      
    // Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is " + savings.balance);
      
    // Withdrawing:
    int afterWithdraw = savings.balance - 300;
    savings.balance = afterWithdraw;
    System.out.println("You just withdrew " + 300);
      
    // Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is " + savings.balance);
      
    // Deposit:
    int afterDeposit = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit;
    System.out.println("You just deposited " + 600);
      
    // Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is " + savings.balance);
      
    // Deposit:
    int afterDeposit2 = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit2;
    System.out.println("You just deposited " + 600);
      
    // Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is " + savings.balance);
  }
}

SavingsAccount.java
public class SavingsAccount {
  
  int balance;
    
  public SavingsAccount(int initialBalance){
    balance = initialBalance;
  }
    
}
